# Track Me

## Tracking based on Background Subtraction

- [ ] Histogram Equalization
- [x] Write skeleton code : get video feed, track moving object BGSub
- [ ] Merge close blobs
- [ ] Try to guess transform parameters (*bird's eye view*) by trial and error
- [ ] [Shadow removal](http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/111781/files/piecewise_shadows.pdf)
- [ ] Label video dataset 
- [ ] Linear Regression to learn transform parameters

## End-to-End Neural Network based location learning

- [ ] Design Architecture
- [ ] Decide input shape and collect labeled data
- [ ] Try with contour images as input
