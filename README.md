# Track Me

## Tracking based on Background Subtraction

- [ ] Histogram Equalization
- [x] Write skeleton code : get video feed, track moving object BGSub
- [ ] ~~Merge close blobs~~
- [ ] ~~Try to guess transform parameters (*bird's eye view*) by trial and error~~
- [ ] [Shadow removal](http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/111781/files/piecewise_shadows.pdf)
- [x] Use triangle similarity method to get focal length
- [x] Use focal length and pixel width to calculate distance from camera
- [x] Moving Average

## End-to-End Neural Network based location learning

- [ ] Design Architecture
